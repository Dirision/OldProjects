This text based war game was created by Nick DiRisio and Joey Lyon as a hybrid
of the popular strategy games Command and Conquer and Advanced Wars.

The purpose of the game is to simulate a skirmish between two of some of the 
three largest armies in the world, China, USA, and Russia. Your goal is to 
eliminate both of the opposing faction's bases before they eliminate 
yours.

+++++RULES+++++
Two maps have been created. Currently only Wasteland is available for play. 

*All units and bases are capitalized for player 1 (left side) and lower case
for player 2 (right side).

You begin with 1000 dollars. Each turn you are given 100 free gold.

Troops can be created by typing yes when prompted.

You can purchase three different types of units: Jets ($700, 150hp, 125 atk,
65def), Tanks($1000, 200 hp, 150 atk, 75 def), and Infantry ($350, 125hp, 
100 atk, and 55 def). They will be spawned next to either of your homebases. 
The weakest troop is infantry, the next strongest is the jet, and the 
strongest is the tank.

There are two oil derricks available on each faction's side available for
capture. Capture by simply moving a unit onto the your sides "D". When
captured these derricks change to "C/c" respectively. Derricks generate an 
additional 100 gold each turn each. You can also capture opponent derricks.

A troops damage is based on the troop who's attacking and who's defending.
Double damage is awarded to the attacking troop if:
Infantry Attacks Jet
Jet Attacks Tank
Tank Attacks Troop

A unit can move a maximum of 3 spaces up or down and 10 spaces left or right.

A unit may attack an enemy unit or base when they are within a 1 square unit 
range up, down, right or left.

You win by destroying both of your opponents bases.
